Goal: Create good looking, somewhat realistic, random fantasy SVG maps for regions. Not only a city, not a whole world, just the size for a cute story, and tiny little adventure, ...

Current state of the project: Trying out different ideas, later then merge some ideas together. If you like to contribute to this project, create a new directory or copy an existing directoy.

  - Ideas (amount of time needed to implement it)
    - 1: Hills
    - 1: a single "Place of Interest" (see below)
    - 2: Palette (grayscale, night/day, color, ancient map, ...)
    - 2: Scaling does not influence stroke thickness
    - 2: better translate level to color for debugging
    - 3: Fill Lakes
    - 3: Rivers (high to low)
    - 3: Bridge: street & river
    - 3: Name Towns & Rivers & Place of Interests (based on seed)
    - 4: Nicely draw names onto map
    - 4: Streets Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
